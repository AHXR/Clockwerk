# Clockwerk
Clockwerk is a Dota 2 rune and camp stacking timer. This program allows a user to keep track and to be reminded of any runes that are spawned or about to be spawned on the map. The user is allowed to set shortcut keys to calibrate the timer with the ingame timer. 

This program was designed to be used for beginner Dota 2 players who have a tendency to not pay attention to the current time. This habit commonly occurs with newer players as they are too focused on what's occuring on the map, thereby causing them to miss their stack times or forget that there is a rune that is about to be spawned.

Clockwerk does not have any memory reading or setting functionalities. Nothing is injected. This is a standalone timer that is toggled through the user's shortcut key.
